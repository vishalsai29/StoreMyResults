      Engineering Students Nowadays do not have the habit of remembering their
      marks of the previous semester or the work rating of the last project in the
      company, this can actually cause a huge problem to students in their final year
      of Engg/if switching companies is taking place, in order to solve this, we here at
      storemyresults.com would love to provide a platform to students/Graduates to
      store their results of the previous/current semester thereby making it
      comfortable to access results and marks accessible whenever required, fun fact,
      Majority of students don’t even remember the marks of their current semester
      and the sophisticated design of result websites make it a little difficult to access
      the same.
